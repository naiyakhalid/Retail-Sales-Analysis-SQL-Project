## 🛠️ Features Implemented: 

### 1. Database & Table Creation
- Created a retail sales table with fields such as `transaction_id`, `sale_date`, `sale_time`, `customer_id`, `gender`, `age`, `category`, `quantity`, `price_per_unit`, `cogs`, and `total_sale`.

### 2. Data Cleaning
- Checked for missing values (`NULL`).
- Imputed missing data using **mean substitution** for:
  - `age`
  - `quantity`
  - `price_per_unit`
  - `cogs`
  - `total_sale`
  - Validated the resulting dataset

### 3. Exploratory analysis
- Total transactions, customers, categories, and sales.
- Gender distribution.
- Quantity of items sold.
- Summary statistics of sales.
- Customer counts
- Category performance

### 4. Business Problem Queries
- Retrieve sales on a specific date.
- Transactions filtered by category & quantity.
